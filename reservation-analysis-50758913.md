## Pattern Analysis

### Key Observations:

1. **"Cancelled" Status Pattern**: 
   - Most bookings show `booking_status: "booked"` even when `cancelled_on` date exists
   - The `cancelled_on` date often equals the `check_out` date
   - This suggests these are **completed stays** where the booking was closed/finalized after checkout

2. **True Cancellations**:
   - Have `booking_status: "cancelled"` 
   - Have `rental_revenue: "0.0"`
   - `cancelled_on` is before `check_in` date

3. **Valid Completed Stays** (for analysis):
   - `booking_status: "booked"`
   - `rental_revenue > 0`
   - Regardless of `cancelled_on` field

## Filtering Logic for Booked Days Analysis

### Current Filter (CORRECT):
```javascript
booking.booking_status === 'booked' && 
parseFloat(booking.rental_revenue) > 0 &&
booking.listing_id === listingData.listing_id
```

### Why This Works:
- ✅ Includes all stays with revenue (actual completed bookings)
- ✅ Excludes true cancellations (revenue = 0)
- ✅ The `cancelled_on` field appears to be administrative (booking closure date)

## Full Year 2024 Statistics

### Dataset Summary:
- **Total Reservation Records**: 50
- **Bookings with Revenue** (status="booked", revenue>0): **44**
- **True Cancellations** (status="cancelled"): 6

### What This Means:
- **44 valid completed stays** are available for pricing optimization analysis
- These bookings have positive revenue and should be included in the booked days analysis
- The system should calculate the average performance vs market based on these 44 stays
