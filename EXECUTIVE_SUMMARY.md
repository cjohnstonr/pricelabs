# PriceLabs API Analysis - Executive Summary

## The Bottom Line

**We CANNOT calculate historical performance vs market using PriceLabs API data.**

## Why Not?

The API has a fundamental temporal gap:

```
Our Historical Data:     [Past 90 days: Jul 25 - Oct 23]
Market Percentile Data:                                [Future only: Oct 24 - Oct 2026]
                                                        ↑
                                                     No Overlap
```

**We have:** Our ADR ($127 for past 90 days)
**We need:** Market median for the SAME period
**We get:** Market median starting TOMORROW (no historical market data)

## What This Means for the Dashboard

### Original Plan (Not Possible)
❌ "OUR AVG VS MARKET" column showing historical performance
❌ "How did we perform vs competitors last quarter?"
❌ Historical market benchmark comparisons

### What We Can Build Instead
✅ "FUTURE MARKET POSITION" - Where we stand vs market going forward
✅ "YEAR-OVER-YEAR TREND" - Our performance vs ourselves last year
✅ "OPTIMIZED TARGET" - AI-recommended pricing based on future market data
✅ "PRICE ADJUSTMENT" - Specific guidance for rate changes

## Recommended Implementation

Replace the three columns with forward-looking alternatives:

| Original (Not Possible) | Replacement (Feasible) | Data Source |
|------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| OUR AVG VS MARKET (Historical) | FUTURE MARKET POSITION | `adr_next_180` vs `Future Percentile Prices` median |
| OPTIMIZED TARGET (Based on historical) | OPTIMIZED TARGET (Forward) | Market median next 30 days × MPI factor |
| PRICE ADJUSTMENT % | PRICE ADJUSTMENT % | `base_price` vs optimized target |

## Next Steps

1. **Review** the full analysis: `API_HISTORICAL_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md`
2. **Update** column definitions to use forward-looking metrics
3. **Implement** the JavaScript code from Section 6.3 of the analysis
4. **Add tooltips** explaining what each metric represents
5. **Test** with live data to validate calculations

## Key Takeaway

While we can't answer "How did we perform vs market historically?" (data doesn't exist), we CAN answer "Where should we price going forward?" with high confidence using market forecasts, MPI, and trend analysis.
