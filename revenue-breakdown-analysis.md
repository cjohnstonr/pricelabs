### Analysis Formulas:
- **Nightly Rate** = `rental_revenue / no_of_days`
- **Cleaning per Night** = `cleaning_fees / no_of_days`
- **Effective Rate** = `(rental_revenue + cleaning_fees) / no_of_days`
- **Impact of Cleaning** = `(Effective Rate / Nightly Rate - 1) Ã— 100%`

## Key Observations:

### 1. **Cleaning Fee Impact by Stay Length**
- **3-night stays**: Cleaning adds 40-45% to nightly rate
- **4-night stays**: Cleaning adds 28-38% to nightly rate
- **5-6 night stays**: Cleaning adds 17-21% to nightly rate

### 2. **Why This Matters for Pricing Optimization**
- When comparing to market median, we MUST use **Effective Rate**
- Market median prices likely include all fees
- Our optimization should consider total revenue per night, not just base rate

### 3. **Recommended Approach for Booked Days Component**

```javascript
// Calculate effective daily rate for accurate market comparison
const effectiveDailyRate = (rental_revenue + cleaning_fees) / nights;

// Compare to market median
const percentageVsMarket = ((effectiveDailyRate - marketMedian) / marketMedian) * 100;
```

## Implementation Recommendation:

### For the Booked Days Analysis Table:
Add these columns:
1. **Accommodation/Night**: Base nightly rate
2. **Cleaning/Night**: Amortized cleaning fee
3. **Effective Rate**: Total per night (for market comparison)
4. **Market Median**: From neighborhood data
5. **% vs Market**: Using effective rate

### Why Split Display Matters:
- **Transparency**: Shows guests true cost breakdown
- **Optimization**: Helps identify if base rate or cleaning fee needs adjustment
- **Short Stay Strategy**: Highlights premium for shorter bookings
- **Market Positioning**: Accurate comparison with competitors
