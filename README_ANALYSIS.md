# PriceLabs API Analysis - Complete Documentation

## Quick Start

**Bottom Line:** We cannot calculate historical performance vs market using PriceLabs API data due to a temporal data gap.

## Key Findings Summary

### What We Discovered

1. **Our Historical Data (Available)**
   - `adr_past_90`: $127 (average daily rate, past 90 days)
   - `revenue_past_30`: $2,720 (revenue, past 30 days)
   - `stly_adr_past_90`: $137 (same-time-last-year ADR)

2. **Market Percentile Data (Future Only)**
   - Start Date: October 24, 2025 (tomorrow)
   - End Date: October 18, 2026
   - Granularity: Daily (360 data points)
   - **Critical Issue:** NO historical market data before today

3. **The Temporal Gap**
   ```
   Our Historical Period:  Jul 25 - Oct 23, 2025 (past 90 days)
   Market Data Period:     Oct 24, 2025 - Oct 18, 2026 (future 360 days)
   Overlap:                ZERO DAYS
   ```

4. **Mathematical Reality**
   ```
   Required: Performance % = (Our ADR - Market Median) / Market Median × 100
   Available: ($127 - ???) / ??? × 100
   Conclusion: Cannot calculate (missing denominator)
   ```

### Why This Matters

To show "OUR AVG VS MARKET" performance percentage, we need:
- ✅ Our historical ADR (we have this)
- ❌ Market historical median for same period (API doesn't provide this)
- ❌ Any way to derive historical market median (mathematically impossible)

The API provides market data starting TOMORROW, but our historical performance is for the PAST 90 days. There's no valid way to compare them.

## Recommended Implementation

### Replace Original Columns With:

| Column | Data Source | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **FUTURE MARKET POSITION** | `adr_next_180` vs `Future Percentile Prices` median | Shows where we stand vs market going forward |
| **YEAR-OVER-YEAR TREND** | `adr_past_90` vs `stly_adr_past_90` | Shows our performance vs ourselves last year |
| **OPTIMIZED TARGET** | Market median next 30 days × MPI factor | AI-recommended pricing based on market data |
| **PRICE ADJUSTMENT** | `base_price` vs optimized target | Specific guidance for rate changes |

### Implementation Code

See `API_HISTORICAL_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md`, Section 6.3 for:
- Complete JavaScript implementation
- Ready-to-use functions
- Color coding logic
- Tooltip text
- Dashboard display examples

## Alternative Approaches Evaluated

We evaluated 5 alternative approaches (all documented in full analysis):

1. ✅ **Forward-Looking Market Comparison** - FEASIBLE
   - Compare projected ADR vs future market median
   - Provides actionable pricing guidance
   
2. ✅ **Year-Over-Year Performance Tracking** - FEASIBLE
   - Compare current period vs same time last year
   - Identifies performance trends
   
3. ✅ **Market Penetration Index Analysis** - FEASIBLE
   - Use PriceLabs' MPI metrics
   - Shows pricing position vs market average
   
4. ✅ **Occupancy Competitiveness** - FEASIBLE
   - Compare our occupancy vs market occupancy
   - Balances pricing vs occupancy strategy
   
5. ✅ **Revenue Performance Indicators** - FEASIBLE (Limited)
   - Track revenue trends over time
   - No market comparison but shows trajectory

## What Questions Can We Answer?

### ❌ Cannot Answer (Data Not Available)
- "How did we perform vs market last quarter?"
- "What was our market share in the past 90 days?"
- "Were we above or below market median historically?"

### ✅ Can Answer (With Confidence)
- "Where do we stand vs market going forward?"
- "How are we trending vs last year?"
- "Should we raise or lower our rates?"
- "What's our projected market position?"
- "How does our occupancy compare to market average?"

## Data Sources Examined

### API Endpoints Tested
1. ✅ `/api/listing/4305303` - Listing details and performance metrics
2. ✅ `/api/neighborhood/4305303` - Market percentile data and KPIs
3. ✅ `/api/listing_prices/4305303` - Daily pricing breakdown
4. ⚠️ `/api/reservation_data/4305303` - Limited reservation data

### Key Response Structures
- **Future Percentile Prices:** 6 percentile series (25th, 50th, 75th, median booked, 90th, unknown)
- **Market KPI:** 10 metric series (monthly granularity, poorly documented)
- **Listing Data:** 40+ fields including historical ADR, revenue, occupancy

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Read `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- [ ] Review `TEMPORAL_GAP_VISUALIZATION.txt`
- [ ] Study implementation code in `API_HISTORICAL_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md` Section 6.3
- [ ] Update column definitions in dashboard specification
- [ ] Implement JavaScript functions for new metrics
- [ ] Add tooltips explaining forward-looking vs historical metrics
- [ ] Test with live API data
- [ ] Update user documentation to explain metric meanings
- [ ] Deploy and validate calculations

## Success Criteria

Implementation is successful when:
1. ✅ Dashboard displays forward-looking market position
2. ✅ Year-over-year trends are visible
3. ✅ Pricing recommendations are actionable
4. ✅ Users understand metric meanings (via tooltips)
5. ✅ Calculations use only available API data
6. ✅ No assumptions or inferred values are used

## Questions or Issues?

1. **Technical Implementation:** See Section 6.3 in `API_HISTORICAL_ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md`
2. **Business Logic:** Review alternative approaches in Section 5
3. **Data Availability:** Check field inventory in Phase 2
4. **Visual Explanation:** Open `TEMPORAL_GAP_VISUALIZATION.txt`
